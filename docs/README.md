Please use Tutorial_ES.pdf for detailed information on analyses of human IDR-ome map


General instructions 
-----------------------

To start looking at the global IDR-ome map, search for proteins of interest and do an exploratory analyses on the clusters
    -- install Java TreeView (http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/)
    
Use
    ES_PW/ANALYSES/clustering.py

   to generate clusters automatically at different thresholding levels
    
Use 
    ES_PW/ANALYSES/es_analyses.py 

  for automatic analysis of GO terms and evolutionary conserved feature enrichments for clusters of interest

Please note: The tutorial (Tutorial_ES.pdf) includes the instructions of how to run the code from a command line on Linux or Windows and how to organize directories so that
